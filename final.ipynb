    "Insider trading, or trading financial assets using information that is not open to the public, is punishable by law in the United States. It is a serious violation -- a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and up to $20 million in fines. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for identifying and conducting investigations regarding insider trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, U.S. senators (and other congresspeople) often have access to information about upcoming policies or laws before the general public, yet are still allowed to trade stocks. More recently, a few senators have been investigated by the SEC for insider trading using knowledge given to them about the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to identify potential insider trading, or suspicious trades, by U.S. senators. We will be using data from https://senatestockwatcher.com/, which itself compiles data from https://efdsearch.senate.gov/. Senate stock watcher aggregates financial disclosures from all senators into one nice dataset."
